SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides "IO::Handle" class with "unread()", a superset of
    stdio's "ungetc()".

    Since the unread() routines of some layers are unstable, do not use this
    module for anything serious. There is NO WARRANTY.

INTERFACE
  *FILEHANDLE*->unread(string [, length])
    Pushes string back into *FILEHANDLE*, which is available for subsequent
    read operations.

    This method returns the unreaded byte length.

EXAMPLE
    Here is an implementation of ungetc(), which deals with one-byte string.

            sub ungetc{
                    my($in, $char) = @_;
                    $in->unread($char, 1) == 1 ? $char : undef;
            }

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    IO::Handle::unread requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    Perl 5.8.1 or later.
